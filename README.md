# 1D-Lagrangian-hydrocode

This lagrangian code follows the adiabatic expansion of a hot spherical bubble in a uniform ambient
medium. The present setup is adjusted to spherical geometry.

This code is based on the Fortran version included in:

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

First, clone the repository:

- Create a directory my_repo on your local machine 
- run 

	git clone https://github.com/eliotayache/1D-Lagrangian-hydrocode my-repo






### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
